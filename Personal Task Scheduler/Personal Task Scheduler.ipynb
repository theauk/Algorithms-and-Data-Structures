    "### Types of Multitasking Tasks and Pairing\n",
    "There are two types of multitasking tasks:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Multitasking tasks with dependencies (MT D).\n",
    "2. Multitasking tasks without dependencies (MT%D).\n",
    " \n",
    "A multitasking task could be taking the bus since it is dependent on walking to the bus stop. On the other hand, a multitasking task without dependencies could be reading about the palace on my phone because I can do that at any time. \n",
    " \n",
    "I need to determine an appropriate way to pair multitasking tasks. In this case, there are three possibilities as the order does not matter:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. (MT D) and (MT D)\n",
    "2. (MT%D) and (MT%D)\n",
    "3. (MT D) and (MT%D)\n",
    " \n",
    "We cannot pair taking the bus with taking another bus, which means that “(MT D) and (MT D)” should not be allowed to happen. Similarly, I cannot both read about the palace and the market at the same time resulting in “(MT%D) and (MT%D)” not being allowed either. Therefore, we can only combine a multitasking task with dependencies with a multitasking task without dependencies “(MT D) and “(MT%D).” \n",
    " \n",
    "### Partitioning\n",
    "We can partition our time in different ways when executing multitasking tasks. We could finish the first multitasking task and then complete the next multitasking task. However, this would defeat the purpose of multitasking as we would be doing the tasks on their own. We could also decide to switch between two tasks. For example, I could ride the bus for a bit, read about the palace for a bit, ride the bus for a bit, etc. Similarly, the latter method also defeats the purpose of multitasking. \n",
    " \n",
    "Partitioning tasks that can be done at the same time would also worsen the time complexity. If we have a total time of two tasks, $n$, and a partitioning happening every, $t$, minutes. Then we would get that our running time would increase by:\n",
    " \n",
    "$(n // t) * O(1)$\n",
    " \n",
    "We can neglect the t as we get a large value of n which would then give us an additional running time of:\n",
    " \n",
    "$O(n)$\n",
    " \n",
    "Therefore, it makes sense to multitask if we want to optimize our time. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ways to Decrease Overall Time\n",
    "\n",
    "We can still consider different ways to improve our multitasking performance. With two multitasking tasks, there can be three cases:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. They have the same time. \n",
    "2. MT D time > MT%D time.\n",
    "3. MT D time < MT%D time.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "When they have the same time, we would go ahead and start and end both tasks at the same time. \n",
    " \n",
    "For case 2, where MT D time > MT%D time, we could do the two at the same time and then finish MT D after MT%D is done. However, when we finish the MT%D task, we could bring in another MT%D task to optimize our time. After doing so, we would update the new MT%D’s time and status so that we can finish it later. For example, if I need to take the bus for 45 min (MTD), read about the palace for 30 min (MT%D) and read about the market for 30 min (MT%D) then I would:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Take the bus while reading about the palace for 30 min.\n",
    "2. Continue taking the bus for 15 min while now reading about the market for 15 min. \n",
    " \n",
    "After this, the bus ride and reading about the palace would be marked as completed. Reading about the market would be marked as in-progress, and its time would be updated to 15 minutes (30 min – 15 min). \n",
    " \n",
    "For case 3, where MT D time < MT%D time, we would start both the MT D task and the MT%D task. However, we cannot finish the MT%D task, so we need to update its status and time to reflect the remaining time left. For example, if taking the bus takes 10 min and reading takes 15 min, then I would:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Take the bus for 10 min while reading for 10 min. \n",
    " \n",
    "When this is done, I will mark the bus ride as executed. The reading status would be set to in progress while the reading time would now be 5 min (15 min – 10 min). \n",
    " \n",
    "Overall, my algorithm will only match a non-dependency multitasking task with a dependency multitasking task because it helps me avoid clashes between tasks that cannot be done at the same time. Furthermore, if possible, I will do several multitasking tasks inside another task because this will decrease my overall time. "

    "## Explanation of Algorithm\n",
    "The algorithm first clusters tasks together in a min heap based on activities with the ones with more dependencies further down the heap. Tasks with zero dependencies are placed at the beginning, and no-dependency multitasking tasks are placed in a separate max heap. When an activity has been placed in a heap, we delete it from a copy of our task list so that we can keep track of when to start further prioritization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, it prioritizes the tasks in the no-dependency multitasking list based on the length of the dependency lists. Furthermore, tasks belonging to an activity are inside the same nested list, and these nested lists are ordered in the same way as the main task heap. As a result, this will optimize our time as we pop out multitasking tasks related to the current activity first. \n",
    "\n",
    "Afterward, we start to pop tasks out of the heap and put them into the schedule list. We do this by having different if-elif-else statements that check if it is a multitasking task and if it has dependencies left. \n",
    "\n",
    "If it is ready to be executed and cannot be multitasked, then we perform it. If it cannot be multitasked but has dependencies left, we place these dependencies in the heap before the main task so that they will be executed next. \n",
    "\n",
    "If it can be multitasked, we check if it has dependencies we need to execute first. If it has, we push those into the heap and execute them. Otherwise, we check if it can be paired with a task from the non-dependency multitasking list. If yes, then we start pairing activities in the way described in part C, which would optimize the time taken. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we both min-heapify the main task heap and max-heapify the non-dependency multitasking list several places in the algorithm to ensure that the next element we pop has the greatest priority. Throughout the process, the algorithm also ensures to update the times, dependency lists, and statuses while also creating the output schedule list. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation of Output\n",
    "The algorithm outputs a schedule with the start and the end time of each task. The number at the beginning of the task indicates the order of each task. If we have two of the same number immediately after each other, then it means that we should multitask those tasks. The latter is also reflected in the start time of multitasking tasks as it is the same for both. Furthermore, a task might be visible more than once. This happens if we partition the task between different multitasking tasks or when we have to finish a task which we did not complete earlier (a task which is still \"in-progress\"). \n",
    " \n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    " \n",
    "### Outputs Proper Schedule\n",
    "After understanding the format of the output and checking the schedule, we can see that the scheduler outputs a list that would make sense to follow. For the output schedule, activity tasks are clustered together, we multitask only between MTD and MT%T tasks, times are updated, and the executing number to the left correctly identifies multitasking (when a number is there twice) or no multitasking (when a number is there once). Furthermore, we stay inside a single day with a starting time at 9 am and ending time at 9:48 pm, and these two times are also realistic in terms of a regular day schedule.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Clustering tasks and Ascending Order\n",
    "Initially, I had difficulties with clustering tasks for different activities together and considered adding an input reflecting a task's activity or chaining all tasks. For example, scoring tasks based on dependencies would ask me to take a bus to the palace and then another bus to the market, although I should visit the palace before leaving for the market. The latter happened because they had the same amount of dependencies. \n",
    " \n",
    "Instead, the algorithm now clusters tasks depending on which activity they belong to, which ensures that the schedule makes sense. This is possible because the algorithm picks a task with the highest number of dependencies and then places it in the main heap. Next, it scores the task's dependencies based on its number of dependencies and puts it in the heap. After this, we lower a counter and repeat the process. Thus, the next cluster of tasks would get scores lower than the tasks belonging to a different activity. \n",
    " \n",
    "Therefore, a person can also use the scheduler if they want to perform activities based on an ascending order of max task dependencies. \n",
    " \n",
    "### Multitasking\n",
    "Another strength of the algorithm is that it takes advantage of our ability to multitask, and it does so without a clash between multitasking tasks that cannot be done together. In the algorithm, we then only multitask when we have a multitasking task with no dependencies and a multitasking task with dependencies. For example, I might as well prepare the hiking route while I am commuting to Isadong. Thus, implementing the algorithm to allow for this type of multitasking saves time.\n",
    " \n",
    "Furthermore, the algorithm does not just pick the first available multitasking task. Instead, it first clusters tasks together in a nested list depending on the activity they belong to, and this order corresponds to the order in the main task heap. Second, inside the sub-lists, the tasks have been ranked based on how many dependencies there are on them. Thus, when we pop the first non-dependency multitasking task, we know that it will be a task that should have higher priority given the format of the main heap. \n",

    "### Criteria for Prioritizing Activities\n",
    "In my algorithm, the last task we execute will be the one that has the task with the max length of its dependency list. Therefore, the last activity we complete is the activity, which includes the latter task. However, this might not be the optimal way to schedule our tasks. \n",
    " \n",
    "For example, I might have two activities: going to the palace and going to the market. In this case, going to the market might have the task with the longest dependency list, which would push the activity to the end of the list, and then we would perform the activities related to the palace first. Still, if the palace has fewer but way longer dependencies timewise than the market's dependencies, then we might be better off going to the market and then the palace. The latter is the case because when we execute the tasks related to the market we might have more opportunities to multitask and thus finish the dependencies for the palace. Thus, switching the activities might improve our overall time. \n",
    " \n",
    "Overall, the algorithm's priority assignment means that there might be potential to optimize the time if we have an input similar to the example with the palace and the market. However, to account for this, we would need a more sophisticated algorithm that performs more calculations and comparisons.  \n",
    " \n",
    "### Making Decisions\n",
    "Initially, my task list was a bit different:\n",
    " \n",
    "After commuting to the Dongdaemun Design Plaza and walking around, I had two tasks which could be performed:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Explore the inside of the Dongdaemun Design Plaza.\n",
    "2. Go inside the design market and find a café. \n",
    " \n",
    "And both of these tasks had the same number of dependencies, status, and multitasking Boolean. Therefore, the algorithm would need to choose which one to do first and then do the next. Initially, I thought that my algorithm would be able to choose one, perform the next one, and then move on. However, this led to a small change in my schedule, where I would have to do some of the tasks related to the Design Plaza earlier and then later do the rest. Therefore, to allow for this type of decision-making, the algorithm would need to be updated to handle this case without wrongly altering the rest of the schedule. \n",
    " \n",
    "### Logistics\n",
    "Although the schedule makes sense, it might not accurately represent reality. For example, I estimated the transportation time for each activity as I do not know exactly where I will be located when I have to commute to the next task of a different activity. I could have chained all the tasks together, but I still wanted the algorithm to determine the order of the activities. To account for the potential time difference, I allocated plenty of transportation time to all commutes, which gives me some buffer time. \n",
    " \n",
    "Furthermore, my schedule also relies on that I can multitask immediately when a non-dependency multitasking task and dependency multitasking task are paired. However, I might not be able to start the non-dependency multitasking task immediately. For example, if I have to commute for 10 min, it might take me a couple of minutes to get in and out of the metro, find a seat, stamp my ticket, etc. Therefore, in real life, all 10 min would not be available for multitasking.
